# End-to-End Training of Deep Neural Networks In the Fourier Domain

**A github repository for end-to-end training of deep neural networks in the Fourier domain**

In this repository You can find our code which implements a neural network in Fourier domain.

### Prerequisites-Installing

To run our code You need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/)  (*v3.9.7*) and  [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (v2.7.0).

### Running our code
